        <h5 class="basic_text">
            Quality education is defined as education that is inclusive and equitable for all people,
            regardless of their background. It not only means building schools and teaching as many people as possible,
            but also having skilled and qualified teachers who can help teach and develop the right skills for their
            students, regardless of their education level.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="basic_text">Some of the main things that the Sustainable Development Goal aims to achieve are to:
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education</li>
            <li>Ensure that all girls and boys are to complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education</li>
            <li>Ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality post-secondary education</li>
            <li>Substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship</li>
            <li>Eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education for the vulnerable, including people with disabilities, indigenous peoples and children in vulnerable situations</li>
            <li>Ensure that all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy</li>
