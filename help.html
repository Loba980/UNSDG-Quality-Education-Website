        <h5 class="basic_text">
            Everyone has the right to an education, and I believe that learning is the most
            important skill that humanity has. All education systems are not perfect; however, they all serve the same
            purpose of teaching and enabling students to learn about the world in which they live in. 
        </h5>
        <h5 class="basic_text">
            When living in more developed countries, many of us have the priviliges of free primary and secondary 
            school eductaion but despite that, there are still many places in the world where gender inequality, lack 
            of funding, and a shortage of qualified teachers prevent people from getting the quality education they deserve.

        <h1 class="title">So, how can you help?</h1>
        <h5 class="basic_text">
            Like me, you can help spread awareness about this issue through talking about it with your friends or 
            making posts about it on social media. You could also get involved directly by looking to work with organizations that
            specalize in improving education in developing countries. Some well known ones include UNICEF, UNESCO, and the The 
            Global Partnership for Education. Another way you could have an impact on this issue is through finical means; there are 
            plenty of different places you could donate to however I recommend you to donate to the
             <a href="https://donate.jointsdgfund.org/" target="_blank" id="donation_link">Joint SDG fund</a>
            or the 
            <a href="https://www.roomtoread.org/" target="_blank" id="donation_link">Room to Read organization.</a>
            Of course you don't only have to follow these two as they are just recommandations and you could always look for other 
            non profits where you feel your money would be best spent.
